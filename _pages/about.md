I am Runqiu Ye (also known as Ray or 叶润秋), 
undergraduate student at Carnegie Mellon University graduating in Spring 2027. 
I study Computer Science and Mathematics. 
I am especially interested in machine learning on the computer science 
side, and analysis on the mathematics side. I am also interested in Physics.

I like to self-study during my free time. For both courses I took 
in Carnegie Mellon University and materials I self-studied, you can find 
my notes under the repositories 
section and my reflections and reviews under the 
blog section with the review tag. I will also post my personal random thoughts 
under the blog section with the thoughts tag.

In summer 2024, I joined Professor Katelyn Breivik's lab to do research in the
field of computational astrophysics. My research topic is on wide post-mass
transfer binary star systems. In summer 2025, I interned at Amazon Web Services 
(AWS) as a software developer intern in the machine learning team.

Besides my academic interests, I love going outdoors and hiking very much. I
enjoy watching and playing sports, especially soccer, baseball, and basketball.
I am most notably known as an Arsenal fan. 
I also like classical music and I enjoy cooking.
