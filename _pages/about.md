I am Runqiu Ye (also known as Ray or 叶润秋), 
undergraduate student at Carnegie Mellon University graduating in Spring 2027. 
I study Computer Science and Mathematics. 
I am especially interested in machine learning on the computer science 
side, and analysis on the mathematics side. I am also interested in Physics.

I like to self-study during my free time. You can
find my notes and reflections, for both courses in Carnegie Mellon University
and materials I self-studied, in this website.

In summer 2024, I joined Professor Katelyn Breivik's lab to do research in the
field of computational astrophysics. My research topic is on wide post-mass
transfer binary star systems. In summer 2025, I interned at Amazon Web Services 
(AWS) as a software developer intern in the machine learning team.

Besides my academic interests, I love going outdoors and hiking very much. I
enjoy watching and playing sports, especially soccer, baseball, and basketball.
I am an Arsenal fan. I also like classical music and I enjoy cooking. 

This website is still in the process of being built. I will try my best to fill
in everything as soon as possible.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
