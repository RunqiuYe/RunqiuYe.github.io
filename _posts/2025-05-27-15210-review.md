Unfortunately not really motivated to do work tonight, so I am going to write 
this course review for CMU 15210, parallel and sequential data structures and 
algorithms.

I took this class in the Spring 25 semester, that is my sophomore spring. 
The instructors are Danny Sleator and Umut Acar. Might be an unpopular 
opinion, especally among the people who took this class the same semester 
as me, but overall I think I like this class, I got an A for the class, 
and I would give this 
class a solid 8 out of 10 for the quality and experience. 

With 15150 introduction to functional programming as a prerequisite, this 
class also uses Standard ML as its language. This is probably the thing I like 
the least of the class. Becuase of the strongly-typed nature of SML, it is 
quite difficult to print things and debug code for homework. This is even 
worse when you are using some data structures like trees. But I guess this 
is the price you need to pay for the "parallel" part of the course. I should 
probably study something more about functional language, especially OCaml 
by myself, but I don't think I have the time for that now.

I speak highly of the quality of the course. The course basically introduces 
all the most basics of the algorithms. The homework problems are also 
classic and inspiring algorithm problems. Aside from that, the parallel 
part of the course is quite interesting. This means we not only need to 
care about the work, which is the traditional sense of time complexity, but 
also we need to care about span. Sometimes there is an interesting trade off 
between each other, as the optimal work solution might be purely sequential. 
I think the course is a great introduction to basic algorithm knowledge, and 
more in-depth content will probably be covered in the sequel of this course 
-- 15451 algorithm design and analysis, which I will take next semester.

Now for the difficulty of the course, I again have to put forward the
potentially unpopular opinion that the difficulty of the class has been 
exaggerated. For the grading scheme, there is a 75% bucket system for the 
homeworks, therefore I think that is easy to max out as long as efforts have 
been put in and there haven't been several accidents. Midterms and finals are
15%, 15% and 20% of the final grade respectively, and they are widely 
described as "very hard". In my opinion this is simply not true. The first 
midterm might caught people off guard, because the actual exam is indeed 
more problems and harder than the practice exams. But for the second midterm 
and the final people should already be clear about one fact -- the practice 
exams the course staff provided are NOT representative of the acutal exam AT 
ALL. In particular, they are visibly too easy for the exam, and the number 
of problems are simply too few for the given time. Some people describe the 
exam as "impossible" in discussion groups like Discord. I think this is 
misleading. For all the exams, I do think the exam problems is a natural 
extension of the content in class and homework, and it is not a wild extension.
If work has been put into the course content and homework problems, the 
exams are definitely not at the level of "impossible". The fear for the 
exam mostly stem from the fact that if you don't come up with the 
correct algorithm for the problem, you get minimum amount of points.
However, there 
are just so few algorithms that has been covered in class, and each problem 
needs at most one of them. Therefore again I would say the exams problems are 
definitely fair, and it is closely related to the course so I think it is 
well written.

One problem in particular seems to trigger some controversy. One 
of them is during midterm 2, a problem asks for a constant in a proof covered 
in class. In my opinion this is a bad problem, because the answer is not the 
unique constant that will make the statement true. It is of course hard to 
recall this specific number when it is actually not the unique answer. 
Even though I attended almost every lecture, but I really don't have a 
deep impression on this. I tried to reproduce the proof and ultimately 
magically get the right answer. Some people refer to this as "lecture 
trivia" and was quite bothered by this 4 point question in an exam 
with an average of 60+. Personally I do not think 
this is a big deal because most people really cannot get this, and the 
course have a very generous curve for the final grade. This is also the only 
instance where something so niche show up on the exam.

All in all, I again want to state my point that the exam problems are fair, 
and the difficulty is exaggerated by some people. Despite the exam being 
a mild time crunch, with all the questions 
being a natural extension of class materials, I could not quite understand 
the very low average score, but why complaining for a good curve, albeit 
I do not need it. 

Other than this, I have some comment on the teaching of the course. The 
teaching and course organization are obviously not good. Notably the algorithm 
needed for one homework problem is not even covered. That is also one of the 
most important algorithm of the section. There are also quite a few bad 
comments toward Professor Sleator, but I personally think his teaching are 
fine compared to some other course which I am about to talk about. In 
particular, I like the way he present things on either blackboard or tablet.
I am never the type of person that spend time comparing different professor 
and adjust my course selections, 
and I will be taking 15451 with him as one of the instructor 
next semester.

As for preparation of the course, I would say LeetCode definitely helps, 
especially NeetCode 150. However for most people that are taking the course, 
LeetCode is already a necessary thing to do for the career, 
so I guess there's no such thing as doing it specifically for the course. 
However, if you haven't done any of that before the class, this class is 
actually a good starting point.
